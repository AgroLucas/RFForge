# RFForge

This project is based on the great [RFStorm nRF24LU1+ Research Firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware).

## Description

RFForge enables both sniffing and spoofing of wireless peripherals that use proprietary protocols.  
This tool was developed as part of the thesis *Radio Based Analysis of Wireless Mice and Keyboards using Proprietary Protocols* presented at the University of Tartu.

## Installation

Refer to the [RFStorm nRF24LU1+ Research Firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware) repository for installation instructions.

## Credits

RFForge was originally a fork of [SySS-Research/keyjector](https://github.com/SySS-Research/keyjector), but all original code has since been removed. The current version is based solely on RFStorm.
